# FaskAPI + React

## Overview

This is a unified full-stack boilerplate designed to eliminate
the repetitive and time-consuming setup tasks that come with starting new web projects.
When kicking off a new frontend-backend separated application, developers often face
the hassle of:

- Designing a reasonable project structure
- Setting up commit conventions
- Organizing and validating environment/config files
- Logging configuration
- Development server and build output wiring
- Preparing the database

This brings everything together into a single monorepo with frontend and backend
fully integrated — and you can launch the whole stack with just one command.

Moreover, this includes ready-to-use universal features essential to most systems:

- :gear: Environment & configuration management
- :closed_lock_with_key: Authentication (login, token, refresh, etc.)
- :bust_in_silhouette: User management
- :busts_in_silhouette: Organization/group management
- :globe_with_meridians: Internationalization (multi-language support)
- :desktop_computer: Admin screens and robust API endpoints

By pre-bundling these common requirements, OPF empowers teams to start building the
actual product immediately — not the boilerplate.
